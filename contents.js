        "qns": "How do I sign up as a seller?",
        "ans": "Sign up on BarkYours by clicking on the “Sell on BarkYours” button on the top right-hand side of the home page.  Create an account by using your Facebook login information or by entering your email address, name and password.  Once you create an account, you can begin selling your items.  Please note that you will need to link your PayPal account, enter your bank account details, or both, to receive payments as your items sell.  This info needs to be added to the payment section of your settings in your BarkYours profile.  To access your settings menu simply click on your profile image."
    },
    {
        "qns": "How do I list an item on BarkYours?",
        "ans": "First, you will need to sign up.  Once you are logged in, simply click on the sell on BarkYours button.  This can be found on the top right-hand corner of the home screen on your desktop or by clicking the drop-down menu on the left-hand side of your mobile home screen. You will then be guided through a series of simple steps to complete your listing."
    },
    {
        "qns": "My item has been purchased.  Why is it still on the site?",
        "ans": "Until you manually close your item it will be visible on the site.  To close your listing, click on the listing item and select the option to “close listing”.  This can be found on the right-hand side of the screen on your desktop or at the bottom of your listing details in mobile view."
    },
    {
        "qns": "My photos are not uploading in the order that I want them to appear, can I change this?",
        "ans": "Yes.  Once you have uploaded your images, you can drag and drop them into any position.  If there is already an image in the position that you want to put another image into, simply drag and drop your selected image into that spot and the original image will move itself into another position."
    },
    {
        "qns": "What are the fees to use BarkYours?",
        "ans": "It is completely free to sign up and free to list items for sale.  BarkYours only charges a commission on items that are sold.  This fee depends on which payment processing service(s) you choose to use.  BarkYours is currently integrated with Stripe and PayPal.  With Stripe, we charge a 10% commission fee on all items sold, with a minimum fee of $1.00 per item sold.  Stripe's payment processing fee is included in this commission fee.  With PayPal, we charge a 7% commission fee, with a minimum fee of $1.00 per item sold.  The PayPal payment processing fee is not included in the commission structure.  Paypal charges a separate transaction fee directly to the seller (which is why BarkYours offers a lower fee).  In the U.S., PayPal's standard transaction fee is 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction; this fee can vary by country.  Commission fees are reduced to 5% and 3%, for Stripe and PayPal, respectively, through January 31, 2019."
    },
    {
        "qns": "Who does BarkYours use to process its payments?",
        "ans": "BarkYours uses Stripe and PayPal to process payments.  As a seller, you can choose which payment method you want to accept, and have the option to accept both.  You can find out more about them at www.stripe.com and www.paypal.com"
    },
    {
        "qns": "Are my bank account details safe on BarkYours?",
        "ans": "Yes. If you choose to accept payments via Stripe, you will need to enter your bank account to receive your money.  Stripe has been audited by a PCI-certified auditor and is certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1.  This is the most stringent level of certification available in the payments industry.

    },
    {
        "qns": "When will I get paid?",
        "ans": "The timing of when you get paid varies depending on whether the transaction is paid for via Stripe or PayPal. With Stripe, once you accept a transaction, it can take up to 10 days for Stripe to deposit money into your bank account. Rest assured that you will get your money. Prior to purchasing your item, a buyer must enter credit card details and the money is held in escrow with Stripe until the funds are released to you. With PayPal, the money moves to your account automatically when you accept the transaction. There is no holding period."
    },
    {
        "qns": "I have accepted the buyer’s payment but it’s not in my bank account. What’s going on?",
        "ans": "If you use Stripe, it can take up to 10 days to receive your payment into your bank account, once you accept a transaction. If you haven’t received your money within 10 days, please contact us at info@barkyours.com and we will do what we can to help.
